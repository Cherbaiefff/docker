## Dockerizing a React App

## Step 1 - Create React App

Create simple create app by using this command `npx create-react-app project_name`

## Step 2 - Add a .dockerignore File

Just like .gitignore file, use .dockerignore for ignoring files while building process.
As a simple example `node_modules` is the folder which is usually excluded.

## Step 3 - Add a Dockerfile

To give instructions, it's needed to create a docker file
Example `Dockerfile` without extension, but also with a capital `D`

## Step 4 - Add instructions

Since react is not a node application, first of all it's neeeded to import node
Example `FROM node:19-alpine`. After `:` you specify the version of node.
Note: Using `alpine` flavour of an image (e.g. `node:16-alpine` instead of `node:16`) will give you a smaller image size

Then you should define a working directory
Example `WORKDIR /app`

After that, package.json and .lock file should be copied. Otherwise, we wonâ€™t be able to use npm commands in the next layer. These files should be copied to the working directory which we defined above. For that, we add a `.` after the copy command. But copying the .lock file is not required. You can exclude
Example `COPY package.json .`

In the next step, we have to install all the dependencies which we used in the project.
Example `RUN npm install`

Then we need to copy the rest of the content to the working directory
Example `COPY . .`

Finally starting an application
Example `CMD ["npm", "start"]`

## Step 5 - Create a docker image

To create a docker image, copy this command into your terminal
Example `docker build . -t <image_name>`

## Viewing the image

To view the image you can use `docker images` or `docker image ls` in your terminal.
Also you can use Docker GUI to view the created image

## Running the image

If you want to run the image, use `docker run <image_name>`
Then you can open new window in terminal and see the list of images by using this command `docker ps`

## Execute the container

To execute it, use `docker exec -it <image_id> sh`
Now you are able to use `npm start` inside.
